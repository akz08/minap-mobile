### Code Navigation
#### minap-desktop-prototype
Contains a Java project from the initial prototype stage. The project is non-functional, as the focus was primarily on completing a model for data validation for the MINAP dataset.

#### minap-monkey-test
Contains a [MonkeyTalk][6] project to help test user interaction/flow throughout the app. 

#### minap-mobile
Contains the main Android project for MINAP. As agreed with the client, the app exists as a proof of concept of mobile data collection in the hospital. Server communication is simulated, but not implemented.
