## Week 3
### Monday - Nov. 18th
As the first milestone draws close, the team started the meeting with a review of the project's specifications both from the client and from the University. We then moved to advance the parts that were lacking. Use cases were tabulated. Further git runthroughs were underway. Finally, our latest meeting with our client was transcribed and questions and answers were extracted from it.

### Tuesday - Nov. 19th
The entire team concentrated on coding.

It was deemed one more client meeting was needed before sending in the project for marking. The team wrote down all questions that may have been left out of previous communications as well as drafting out a survey prototype per client's suggestion. 

Meeting was adjourned after considering a Gantt chart for drafting out the schedule of the work packages.

### Wednesday - Nov. 20th
Our meeting with our client and the web application's developer went as expected. We followed up with the developer on some clarification due to the complexities of both our project and the existing web app.

Once again, the team checked the project's specifications and listed the yet unfinished sections.

### Thursday - Nov. 21st through Sunday Nov. 24th
The team worked throughout the rest of the week on any and all missing sections of the project. 

Coding took place throughout most of these four days. During coding breaks, the team worked on the project report, Gantt chart, data dictionary, or UML specifications.

On Sunday, November 24th, at 4:52 P.M., the team gathered all it sources and turned the project in for marking.
