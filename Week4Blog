## Week 4
### Monday - Nov. 25th
The App Dev team decided it would be in everyone's best interest if no coding took place the day after the University's deadline. Instead, the team looked ahead to the second deadline three weeks away. Wiki resources were updated, Milestone 2 requirements were read and understood. Finally, we presented our client with a possible survey to be used for data gathering / analytics.

### Tuesday - Nov. 26th
Per our client's wishes, the dataset has been reduced to 60 fields from 130 fields. The team first fleshed out how these reduced dataset would interact within the application. Abstraction was taken into account as all most of these fields would require alike functionality. 

After separating the fields into logical "pages," the meeting focused on the transition from Java coding to integrating SQL and XML into the product's code.

### Wednesday - Nov. 27th
The team reviewed extra documents from client that further helped with dataset rules. Sample decisions trees were sketched as per the new validation logic. Meeting was adjourned after an email to client with some questions for clarifications was sent. 

### Thursday - Nov. 28th
The client's reply cleared all questions from previous meeting. After discussing this new information, the team focused on University tasks, namely the GC02 poster that would be due next Wednesday (the 4th).

After a brief discussion. It was decided that meetings for Friday and the weekend (the 29th through Dec 1st) would be unnecessary. As such, the team divvied up work packages to clear during these days including: 
+ Making sure Java validation works on a command line level
+ Making sure XML parsing works on a command line level
+ Making sure SQL connection / read / write capabilites work on a command line level
+ Further insight into Android programming, HCI requirements
