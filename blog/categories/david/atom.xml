    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throughout this project, I&rsquo;ve been mostly involved with the back-end logic and design, and though my &ldquo;share&rdquo; has its importance, in the end it is the user interface that will be presented to our end users. Having said that, using the mobile application was, for this particular user, a painless experience.</p>

<p>There is familiarity in the way the application is presented. As of this writing, our application is not complete; yet I can&rsquo;t help but make parallels between the existing web application and our solution. The way input is asked from the user is identical on both applications: radio buttons, drop-down lists, text / date fields are all included, work and (for the most part, given the reduced working space) are presented in the same order. Functionally, our solution works as the web application does. A record needs only four fields be filled in order to be saved, but provides enough fields to complete six full information pages.</p>

<p>The overall design of our solution is, for lack of a better term, aesthetically sound. There are no elements that go unused or misused, everything on the screen is there for a clear reason. Furthermore, the design is clean. Colours are used sparingly, but contrast well when needed (especially on radio button selection).</p>

<p>Navigation has remained faithful to the web application as well. Next and Back buttons work on our app as they do online, keeping a linear approach. Yet the addition of a drawer navigation object will allow for faster navigation and data input for those users that may be more experienced than most. Slight reminders or visual cues, the clearest one being having to scroll down to the end of the page in order to continue, make for a more user friendly experience.</p>

<p>As a final note, it should be pointed out that this application is meant for medical professionals. As such, terminology is not suited for all users. Tooltips also will only help those that are familiar with MINAP and their web application.</p>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/15/looking-inside/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Current Solution Analysis</h3>

<p>MINAP&rsquo;s participants use a web application for data capture. The web application is limited in its use to the Windows platform as well as to the Internet Explorer (ver 9 and below) web browser. While hospitals and clinics have this in mind, and thus have their equipment ready for these limitations, newer participants may need to go out of their way to accommodate MINAP&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<h3>Logging in</h3>

<p><img src="/images/login.png" title="Login Screen" ></p>

<p>Authorised users are given a set of credentials unique to them. These credentials then create a session that keeps track of both the user and the user&rsquo;s workplace throughout the data capture process and are automatically filled in to the appropriate fields in the web application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/legal.png" title="Legal Start Screen" ></p>

<p>If the user&rsquo;s log in details are cleared against MINAP&rsquo;s users database, a legal disclaimer page will be shown in order to protect the sensitive data about to be used.</p>

<h3>Data Capture</h3>

<p><img src="/images/initial-diagnosis.png" title="Initial Diagnosis Screen" ></p>

<p>Data Capture itself can take several minutes to an hour depending on the patient&rsquo;s information. The navigation buttons along the left side of the screen are of no concern for this project. The right side of the screen will display the patient&rsquo;s demographic information as well as identifying the user that created the record in use across the top half.</p>

<p>Each pages' bottom half will display the controls necessary to capture the patient&rsquo;s information. Controls that may be used include (but are not limited to) text fields, buttons, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and calendar input boxes. Data validation can happen once exiting the particular field or page, or when saving the record. In addition each field contains a tool tip for the information that it captures as well as the corresponding field number in MINAP&rsquo;s dataset.</p>

<p>Navigation-wise, each page has at least three buttons: &ldquo;Save&rdquo; places all data onto a permanent record (it will not, however, navigate or indicate in any way that the saving has taken place); &ldquo;Close&rdquo; will end the data capture without saving progress (a message box will inform the user of this), the user will then be directed to a listing of all patients entered into the system. The other three buttons: &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, &ldquo;Back&rdquo; and what MINAP refers to as the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; need further looking into.</p>

<p><img src="/images/compass-screen.png" title="Compass Screen" ></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is, in essence, a navigation map. Pressing this button will bring the user to a flow-diagram-like display of the pages that are available for data capture. The user can then navigate directly to the page desired provided it is available. If the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is not used, the web app has a linear way of navigating through screens. &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will fulfill the expected functions in this linear way. It should be noted that if the user accessed a page via the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; page, pressing &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will not bring up the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo;, but the page that precedes the current display in the previously mentioned linear navigation.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that throughout the data capture process, the decisions made across certain field or fields will trigger the appearance of one or more fields and even entire pages for further capture.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>While the web app MINAP currently uses has served its purpose, it could stand to receive an update. There are areas that are no longer obscure to its users only because of their current use of the app. As a group, we had a tough time getting to know the finer details of the system and even our client had to, at times, consul with her coworkers in order to answer some of out questions.</p>

<p>In our solution, we must do away with as many of these gray areas and make our solution as intuitive as possible without losing major functionality.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The team has come to realize that in order to continue the objectives this blog is to meet, it must come clean. Up to this point, information regarding our client and project has been, to a point, redacted. This is a practice that will hinder rather than help from this point on.</p>

<h3>Our Client: Project Manager for MINAP</h3>

<p><img src="/images/minap-logo.png" title="MINAP logo" ></p>

<p>The Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) investigates the management of heart attacks. Participating hospitals and ambulance services are to provide a record of their management practices. These records are then compared to national and international clinical standards. The National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) is a partnership of clinicians, IT experts, analysts, academics and managers. Its mission is to &ldquo;provide information to improve heart disease patients' quality of care and outcomes&rdquo;. Using different audits, MINAP being one of them, NICOR aims to provide the NHS, government and regulatory bodies real world data to be used in patient care. The team&rsquo;s primary point of contact is the Project Manager for MINAP, who we have referred to as the &lsquo;client&rsquo; in previous posts.</p>

<h3>Our Project: A mobile solution</h3>

<p>Participating facilities are requested to enter all patients with suspected heart attack. Data is collected by nurses and other clinical audit staff and entered in a dedicated web application. This web application collects all patient data, from demographics to diagnosis and release information. As it stands, the web application contains a 130 field dataset that is updated every two years (latest revision, June 2013). The data is then validated against a set of rules which include, but are not limited to, value range checks, date range checks, data type checks and encryption rules. Once completed, records are stored on MINAP&rsquo;s Domino server. A further look into the web application will be posted in a later post.</p>

<p>The app dev team has been tasked to produce a mobile application that will serve as a starting point for the data capture process, thus relieving clinicians of some of the burden of data entry. This project will retain the major functionality of the web application while working with a slightly reduced dataset. Validation and storage must be taken into account, as well as maintaining a semblance of familiarity for the current user base. The target platform for this mobile solution is the Android OS for smartphones.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to get a better grasp on the usability and usage of the project. The team would like to introduce our persona, Julie.</p>

<p><img class="<a" src="href="http://placekitten.com/200/200">http://placekitten.com/200/200</a>" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<p>Julie is a 28-year-old Nurse working in the General Hospital (MINAP Code: YYY). She is in charge of admitting and taking care of all types of patients at General Hospital.</p>

<p>Due to budget constraints, Julie cares for multiple patients at the same time gathering data for other organizations in addition to MINAP. Since entering a patient&rsquo;s data for MINAP&rsquo;s web application requires being physically in front of a computer as well as time to complete the record, Julie finds the whole process &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Julie is tech-savvy in that she owns a smartphone, she has never used it for work, though. However, as she has some time with the patient while they are being admitted, Julie wonders if she could at least flag the patient for later input to MINAP&rsquo;s database through her smartphone.</p>

<p>As she checks in a new patient, Julie wonders&hellip; &ldquo;Is there an app for that?&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/02/week-4/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-02T14:44:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/02/week-4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 25th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The App Dev team decided it would be in everyone&rsquo;s best interest if no coding took place the day after the University&rsquo;s deadline. Instead, the team looked ahead to the second deadline three weeks away. Wiki resources were updated, Milestone 2 requirements were read and understood. Finally, we presented our client with a possible survey to be used for data gathering / analytics.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 26th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Per our client&rsquo;s wishes, the dataset has been reduced to 60 fields from 130 fields. The team first fleshed out how these reduced dataset would interact within the application. Abstraction was taken into account as all most of these fields would require alike functionality.</p>

<p>After separating the fields into logical &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; the meeting focused on the transition from Java coding to integrating SQL and XML into the product&rsquo;s code.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 27th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team reviewed extra documents from client that further helped with dataset rules. Sample decisions trees were sketched as per the new validation logic. Meeting was adjourned after an email to client with some questions for clarifications was sent.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 28th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The client&rsquo;s reply cleared all questions from previous meeting. After discussing this new information, the team focused on University tasks, namely the GC02 poster that would be due next Wednesday (the 4th).</p>

<p>After a brief discussion. It was decided that meetings for Friday and the weekend (the 29th through Dec 1st) would be unnecessary. As such, the team divvied up work packages to clear during these days including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making sure Java validation works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure XML parsing works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure SQL connection / read / write capabilities work on a command line level</li>
<li>Further insight into Android programming, HCI requirements</li>
</ul>
