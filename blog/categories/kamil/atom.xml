    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Standing on the shoulders</h3>

<p>During the early development phases, David made several sketches of a preliminary UI to show to our client to ensure we had captured all the functionality that we had agreed on. The focus was more on functionality, rather than specific UI decisions, since we had yet to nail down our target mobile platform. The client was happy with our design decisions &ndash; with some suggestions for functionality &ndash; but our requirements have significantly changed since then, and we now have a mobile platform that we have decided to stick to (Android). Despite this, much of the new UI design is based off these preliminary sketches.
<img src="/images/david-paper-ui.png" title="One of David&rsquo;s preliminary UI sketches" ></p>

<h3>New beginnings</h3>

<p>To help with the redesign, I took over the process of creating the new GUI, and started off with a clean slate (piece of paper).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blank-sheet.JPG" title="Blank page template" ></p>

<p>I printed out several templates (made in MS Word) around the size of a typical Android smartphone&rsquo;s screen to keep myself within the constraints of a phone. The black bar at the bottom is meant to represent Android&rsquo;s &ldquo;soft buttons&rdquo; for navigation on newer phones without menu keys built into the hardware (as seen on the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/ui-overview.html" title="Android Navigation Bar">developer website under the heading &ldquo;System Bars&rdquo;</a>). For this case, phones with the soft navigation bar primarily differ from older phones (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S" title="Nexus S">Nexus S</a>) in that they move the roles of the hardware &ldquo;menu&rdquo; button to an &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; soft-button on the Android action bar. I assumed the newer behaviour when designing the interface.</p>

<h3>First steps</h3>

<p>Based on the information I gleaned from the Android developer website, I started to piece together a rough idea of a mobile interface for MINAP. The purpose of this initial sketch was as a personal brainstorming session &ndash; the notes aren&rsquo;t meant to be legible to anybody else.
<img src="/images/ui-sketch-initial.jpg" title="Initial UI sketches" >
The process of starting the app and logging in was initially designed to closely match the current web app&rsquo;s interface. The legal disclaimer, login screen, and the options menu to create a new record was included to make the longtime MINAP user comfortable with the interface.</p>

<p>The process of creating a record would first prompt the user to enter in patient details, with a button labelled &ldquo;Confirm&rdquo;, to give weight to the importance of information entered on that page. As mobile screens rarely give signifiers for scrolling (unlike most desktop interfaces), confirmation and navigation buttons are located at the bottom of the page&rsquo;s content. This forces the average user to view all data entry fields before progressing further, hopefully helping with data completeness.</p>

<p>The concept of using a navigation drawer to give feedback on the current session and &ldquo;quick navigation&rdquo; is also explored here. The navigation drawer would animate in from the left when the user transitions into the navigation page from touching the &ldquo;Confirm&rdquo; button (on Patient Details). Since the navigation drawer is typically hidden with (few) visual signifiers, this acts as both a reminder and introduction of its existence.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ui-part-1.JPG" title="Part 1" ></p>

<p>The overflow button (3 vertical dots) should be used for less-used features, such as logging out, settings, and help. Ideally, we would like to have the &ldquo;Log out&rdquo; option more prominently displayed, but space on the action bar is at a premium, and is used for more important tasks such as saving (classic floppy icon). More concerned users such as Edward are however more likely to explore the app in its entirety. Despite this, I&rsquo;ve explored the option of &ldquo;auto log out&rdquo; as a default in the settings. There are however implications of making this a default behaviour (e.g. data loss), so the concept should be explored a bit more.</p>

<p>In the future, the navigation map would be pretty big, so I&rsquo;ve explored some methods of manipulating the map with touch inputs as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ui-part-2.JPG" title="Part 2" ></p>

<p>As a final touch, I&rsquo;ve tried to get a feel on how the help tooltips would be represented in the mobile app. The current web app uses a question mark for its icon, but I figured that since most users of a mobile version would likely be new to MINAP data entry, a more widely used &ldquo;i&rdquo; for &ldquo;information&rdquo; would be better recognised.
<img src="/images/ui-part-3.JPG" title="Part 3" ></p>

<h3>Cleaning up</h3>

<p>To ensure I was making reasonably informed decisions with the UI, I redrew my preliminary sketches whilst consciously culling unnecessary features.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ui-sketch-final.jpg" title="Final (initial) UI sketches" ></p>

<p>One of the major changes I made was the culling of the page where users are given the option to create a record or a &lsquo;stub&rsquo;. To help with the focus of our app on record creation, we should remove all options that may deviate away from this core purpose. Creating patient record stubs could instead be handled in a more streamlined fashion (automated, perhaps) to avoid the users from making a mistake of choosing the wrong option on first opening the app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ui-part-4.JPG" title="Part 4" ></p>

<p>The concepts about keeping navigation buttons at the end of the page previously discussed can be seen more clearly in the photo below. Information buttons are also clearly associated with each value label, triggering a dialog box which can be easily dismissed with a clearly labelled button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ui-part-5.JPG" title="Part 5" ></p>

<p>My sketches, though more legible was still not quite in a state that would allow me to clearly illustrate my ideas for the mobile interface to our client. To better do this, I had to employ the power of technology &ndash; and a bit of magic (i.e. imagination).</p>

<h3>A touch of magic</h3>

<p>A rather nifty app that helped with this process was <a href="https://popapp.in/" title="POP app">&ldquo;POP&rdquo; (Prototyping on Paper)</a>. The app is an Android/iOS solution to converting paper prototypes to semi-functional Wizard of Oz prototypes. Unfortunately, the Android version was very buggy, so I had to create my pseudo-app on an iPhone &ndash; hence the added imagination.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat hard to describe how exactly I transformed the sketches into an interactive prototype, so I&rsquo;ll let the video below demonstrate.</p>

<p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yi91OxmUkG8 "></iframe></div></p>

<p>The fake &lsquo;swiping&rsquo; on the Patient Details page was intentional, as the app only allows capturing touches on bounding boxes. This was pretty much how I presented the app to our client &ndash; using a bit of magic to convince our client it was running on an Android device (I think it worked&hellip;).</p>

<h3>Getting feedback</h3>

<p>Having a tangible product to show to the client helped with getting more concrete feedback. The comments from our client were pretty positive overall, with some key points of concern:</p>

<ul>
<li>despite owning an Android phone herself, she had not encountered the use of the navigation drawer before</li>
<li>she would <em>really</em> appreciate a tutorial for less experienced users (we will if time permits&hellip;)</li>
</ul>


<p>Despite the concerns about the navigation drawer, I think the concept would probably be better demonstrated with an actual working prototype. Although our client had a go at &lsquo;running&rsquo; our app, it was limited in scope due to the input limitations of the system. I aim to continually gather client feedback once we have a semi-functional app running on Android.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-19T14:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/19/android-ui-elements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve owned an Android smartphone for three years before switching over to a hand-me-down iPhone, and went through Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich(4.0). Having spent the first 2 years dealing with Gingerbread, switching to the new interface of Android 4.0 was a breath of fresh air. ICS introduced a cleaner UI with a clearer design language. Our decision to only support devices from ICS onwards are primarily due to security concerns, but the availability of more (intuitive) UI elements and ways to present our app is really just the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>To get a clearer idea of the UI elements available to us, I had a look through the official Android UI website, identifying the main elements available for use. This was just a very brief run through, as I realised the documentation regarding the recommended use of the elements by Google were quite thorough &ndash; which I intend to constantly refer to throughout the building of the app UI.</p>

<p>Platform specific UI patterns of interest (images taken from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/index.html">Android developer website</a>:</p>

<h4>Action Bar</h4>

<p><img src="/images/action_bar_basics.png" title="Action Bar image from the Android Developer website" >
The action bar acts as a persistent UI pattern that can be used across all pages. Less important functionality such as Logging out could be kept in the &lsquo;overflow&rsquo; (3 vertical dots) menu, and key features such as saving could use prominent icons (the classical floppy disk). The icon (labelled 1) for ancestral navigation could also be made contextual, such that it could change to be a compass icon when the user navigates to a data entry page.</p>

<h4>Navigation drawer</h4>

<p><img src="/images/navigation_drawer_overview.png" title="Navigation Drawer image from the Android Developer website" >
Our mobile app&rsquo;s key purpose is to allow for quick data collection at the point of contact with the patient. With tech savvy users such as Julie, we would like to include as many time-saving shortcuts to frequently accessed features as possible. The navigation drawer could be introduced as an alternative way to navigate around the pages, as opposed to constantly visiting the navigation map. The typical way of navigation (according to our client) involves the user &lsquo;hopping&rsquo; around different pages when entering information (making the back and next buttons redundant &ndash; but we are keeping them for familiarity). A good use of the drawer would be to allow quick navigation around pages, as well as maybe giving the user feedback on who they are logged in as, and who the current patient being recorded is.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-19T14:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/19/android-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To create a truly native application that users of the mobile platform can easily navigate, I figured that I needed to understand the common design language of the operating system (OS). So in preparation for mapping information and navigation of the current MINAP web app onto Android, I had a look through the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html">official design principles of Android OS</a>. At first glance, the Android design principles don&rsquo;t seem to relate to our medical data entry app at all (&ldquo;delight me in surprising ways&rdquo;?), but specific points can be picked out. From the three main principles (Enchant me, Simplify my life, Make me amazing), some outlined sub-principles of the document can be taken onboard in the design of the app:</p>

<h3>Simplify My Life</h3>

<h4>Keep it brief:</h4>

<p>Although the core content of the app cannot be changed due to the precise nature of medical data input, we can keep our tutorials short with simple language</p>

<h4>Only show what I need when I need it:</h4>

<p>Breaking down the tasks of using the application strikes me as an area which we could improve on the current app, with a wealth of possible options available to me upon opening the web app. If we expect the app to have more widespread usage, the process of record creation should be fairly intuitive to someone with limited prior knowledge.</p>

<h4>I should always know where I am:</h4>

<p>There are two main &lsquo;modes&rsquo; which our user would be most active in during use: navigation mode, and page data entry mode. It should be clear how the user will navigate back and forth through the app, allowing for multiple possible ways (i.e. back button, or a navigator icon)</p>

<h4>Never lose my stuff:</h4>

<p>Due to security concerns and data protection, we shouldn&rsquo;t retain a local copy of entered data beyond the duration of the session. Despite this, we could &lsquo;autosave&rsquo; the entered data into a &lsquo;draft&rsquo; database on the central server, with visual indicators to let the user know the data has been submitted for storing (the expected web app behaviour is manual saving).</p>

<h4>If it looks the same, it should act the same:</h4>

<p>We should keep in mind what we mean when using Android UI elements (i.e. if it looks like a text box, it should act like one) to ensure they retain the same meaning throughout the app.</p>

<h3>Make Me Amazing</h3>

<h4>Give me tricks that work everywhere:</h4>

<p>Gestures such as swiping from the edge for menus aren&rsquo;t good for a primary interface due to discoverability issues for novice users, but can serve to speed up the workflow of more experienced users.</p>

<h4>It&rsquo;s not my fault:</h4>

<p>When informing the user of validation errors, it would be helpful to consider if the warnings could be reworded for clarity and &lsquo;niceness&rsquo;.</p>

<h4>Make important things fast:</h4>

<p>The ability to switch between pages and the mode of data entry and navigation should be effortless. It should also be relatively easy to check details of the session such as the current logged in username and patient core details.</p>

<p>To make UI decisions easier, I will be aiming to follow these principles as closely as possible in conjunction with the core Android UI elements and more detailed design guidelines which I hope to cover in a future post.</p>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/17/finding-competition/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-17T14:01:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/17/finding-competition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Medical data entry applications are a new concept (and also likely to be distributed solely within the company), so direct competitors are hard to come by on all major mobile app stores. One element of our app solution that could be used as a basis for finding similar solutions is the navigation panel. On a 1024 x 768 desktop browser, the user can easily read all the text and possible pathways at a glance. Directly mapping this onto a small device (smartphone) would yield unreadable text if naively shrunk to fit the screen; enabling a simple zoom-in and out approach would require too much scrolling in arbitrary directions to view the complete navigation map.</p>

<p>To get some ideas on how we could best represent this tree-navigation structure, we had a look through the apps on our own smartphones. Interestingly enough, a language learning app had the closest representation of the current MINAP navigation tree.</p>

<h3>Duolingo</h3>

<p>Duolingo, a language learning mobile app, relies on a central &lsquo;learning tree&rsquo; to show the user&rsquo;s progress of language learning. The user progresses through different levels, clearly separated by horizontal rules, containing individual units of activities.
<img src="/images/duolingo-main.png" title="Duolingo main screen" ></p>

<p>Each unit is an icon, associated with a short description of its associated meaning. Colour is used to signify the ability to access the units: with greyscale to mean inactive, and a coloured icon to mean active. User progress in the units are indicated as well, through use of fractions and &lsquo;level bars&rsquo; (which is puzzling), using colours and greyscale again to indicate level of completeness. As with most modern designs, Duolingo has done away with scroll bars to signify the ability to scroll downwards, but overcomes this problem by having an icon &lsquo;peeking&rsquo; out from the bottom of the screen &ndash; indicating that there is more content below.</p>

<p>Due to the working environment that our app would be used in, we need to ensure a professional look &ndash; so we can&rsquo;t use vibrant colours and iconography as extensively as Duolingo. However, the use of very distinct colours to indicate level of completeness and access could be adopted for quick recognition of the completion &lsquo;status&rsquo; of each page on the navigation map, to suit the quick nature of patient record creation intended in our mobile app. The current (MINAP) web app employs the same colouring strategy, though using more subtle hues, compatible with the more relaxed and slow process of data entry at the computer.</p>

<p>Additionally, the organisation of levels in Duolingo lack a sense of coherence, with the utilitarian grey divider not conveying any sign of connection between the different levels. The MINAP web app has the problem of dealing with &lsquo;levels&rsquo; containing up to 7 pages, which unfortunately won&rsquo;t fit with Duolingo&rsquo;s method of mapping.</p>

<h3>Reddit Sync</h3>

<p>Reddit Sync is a (3rd-party) mobile client app for a popular online community sharing website, Reddit. Its primary purpose is for consuming content quickly and giving feedback on posted content by votes or comments. The app makes heavy use of the card metaphor, with card metadata and actionable items prominently featured.
<img class="left" src="/images/reddit-sync-main.png" title="Reddit Sync main screen" ></p>

<p>What I found most interesting about Reddit Sync however, was its use of the Android navigation drawer. Reddit is divided into separate interest groups/sections called &lsquo;subreddits&rsquo;, which contain posts related to a particular topic. These sections are analogous to the pages in the MINAP dataset, and could be used as a quick alternative way (a navigation list) to traverse through the many pages.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sync-drawer.png" title="Reddit Sync navigation drawer" ></p>

<p>One other interesting feature is how the app deals with multiple logins. It is common practice on Reddit for users to manage multiple accounts for their different online personas. Reddit Sync prominently displays your currently logged in username at the top of the navigation drawer, with a &lsquo;spinner&rsquo; &ndash; an Android signifier indicating the ability to choose between several options. Touching this spinner allows the user to switch between accounts on the fly. Such an interface could be useful in the near future to allow MINAP users to switch between accounts registered to different hospitals under their name.

    <updated>2013-12-16T14:10:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/16/platform-choice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For our MINAP mobile application, we have chosen to go with the Android mobile platform. One of the main reasons behind this choice of platform (as opposed to the option of creating a mobile web app) was due to the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/space/" title="Sencha Space">issues of security</a> if the app is developed further in the future for actual use in the hospital. A native application would be the ideal choice, to ensure full utilisation of the platform&rsquo;s security features.</p>

<p>A bonus of choosing the Android platform (or any native platform, really) helps lock down the user interface to the design standards in place, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Most apps would conform to these standards, and so it would help with reducing the cognitive load when learning to use our mobile app.</p>

<p>Although this would mean a departure from the current web app&rsquo;s structure (programming-wise), the benefits of following UI standards and security will hopefully far outweigh the initial cost of time (and effort) in programming.</p>
