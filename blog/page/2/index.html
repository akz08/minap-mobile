		<p>The two personas we&rsquo;ve introduced are pretty tech savvy, currently owning smartphones for a considerable amount of time. Where are all the non-savvy users?</p>

<p>The MINAP dataset and interface is a very complicated system to the first-time user (as we have experienced first hand), and reducing this complexity to a mobile device whilst still retaining most (if not all) the functionality of the web app is (I think) a monumental task. Whilst we will keep in mind that not all users have used smartphones before, I believe the requirement of the user having had previous experience with mobile apps is necessary to avoid them being overwhelmed by the experience of entering data into the MINAP system on a mobile device.</p>

<p>Obviously, the easiest way to mitigate this problem is to include a tutorial (which was also suggested by our client). I personally believe that most users tend to skip tutorials anyway, and that the time is better spent trying to make the app as intuitive as possible for the more experienced users. We will however provide a tutorial for our app in the near future &ndash; if time permits.</p>

		<h3>Why we need Edward</h3>

<p>As part of our effort to better know our end users, we ran a quick survey with our client to find out just how many MINAP users own a smartphone, and their willingness to use their personal devices for work. Our client deployed the survey via SurveyMonkey to MINAP&rsquo;s current user-base, and encouraged them to forward the link around. The survey has been running for about a week now, and will be left open for several more weeks to allow more responses, but 79 responses have been collected so far.</p>

<p>As the questions in the survey primarily involved more technical questions (such as &ldquo;what brand is your phone/tablet?&rdquo;), a more in depth commentary will be included in the report associated with this development blog. However, we have included questions such as :</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you currently use your smartphone/tablet for work-related activities during work hours? (Yes / No)</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Would you use an app on your smartphone/tablet if it helped supplement your work? (Yes / No)</p></blockquote>

<p>with a section at the end for freeform comments to allow further feedback.</p>

<p>So far, 72.4% of surveyed users responded No to using their personal devices for work-related activities, but 75.3% answered Yes to the possibility of using an app for supplementing their work. From these two responses alone, it looks like people are willing to use new technology &ndash; just not their own. The picture becomes clearer when having a look at the comments left by the users:</p>

<blockquote><p> We are not allowed to use our phones on wards so not sure how this would work. Our trust is very unlikely to buy a tablet for use by MINAP [&hellip;] If I had the equipment and an App available, I would be very happy to use it.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p> I would be more than willing to use a smartphone / table for work related activities if it was provided by work. Currently I use a personal iPhone only and would breach confidentiality / clinical governance issues if this was used for work related activities.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Any devices used in the workplace would have to be procured by our IM&amp;T Dept.</p></blockquote>

<p>show obvious concerns with regards to data protection and security, preventing the use of personal devices for work from both a personal and work perspective.</p>

<p>This is a key factor that has convinced us to ensure that our application will <em>not</em> be used in any real-life setting until a proper security audit has been performed. However, from a usability perspective, we need to ensure that users concerned about security are being reminded that the data entered into our mobile app is stored, transmitted, and securely deleted from the device when completing a record.</p>

<p>To help remind us of this issue, we have created Edward &ndash; a security conscious 30 year old clinician. Unlike Julie, who was born of feedback from the client, Edward reflects the more privacy-concerned users.</p>

<h3>So who is Edward anyway?</h3>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/300/200" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<ul>
<li>(extremely) tech savvy single 30 year old clinician</li>
<li>owns a (personal) tablet and smartphone</li>
<li>enjoys a good work-life balance</li>
<li>frequent reader of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></li>
<li>works in a hospital trust on a tight budget</li>
<li>loves efficiency</li>
<li>is professional with his patients, and respects their privacy</li>
<li>constantly saves his work and is meticulous with organising files</li>
</ul>


<p>Edward would love to streamline his workflow for entering patients into the MINAP dataset, but is well aware of data privacy laws governing patient data. As such, he begrudgingly enters patients into MINAP on Internet Explorer, but knows full well of the dangers of data leaks. He checks the application privileges on his tablet and smartphone before installing any new apps, and has helped some of his friends remove obnoxious apps from their own devices. He is distrusting of how secure mobile apps are, but can see their potential as time savers at work&hellip;</p>

		<p>In order to get a better grasp on the usability and usage of the project. The team would like to introduce our persona, Julie.</p>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<p>Julie is a 28-year-old Nurse working in the General Hospital (MINAP Code: YYY). She is in charge of admitting and taking care of all types of patients at General Hospital.</p>

<p>Due to budget constraints, Julie cares for multiple patients at the same time gathering data for other organizations in addition to MINAP. Since entering a patient&rsquo;s data for MINAP&rsquo;s web application requires being physically in front of a computer as well as time to complete the record, Julie finds the whole process &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Julie is tech-savvy in that she owns a smartphone, she has never used it for work, though. However, as she has some time with the patient while they are being admitted, Julie wonders if she could at least flag the patient for later input to MINAP&rsquo;s database through her smartphone.</p>

<p>As she checks in a new patient, Julie wonders&hellip; &ldquo;Is there an app for that?&rdquo;</p>

		<p>The team has come to realize that in order to continue the objectives this blog is to meet, it must come clean. Up to this point, information regarding our client and project has been, to a point, redacted. This is a practice that will hinder rather than help from this point on.</p>

<h3>Our Client: Project Manager for MINAP</h3>

<p><img src="/minap-mobile/images/minap-logo.png" title="MINAP logo" ></p>

<p>The Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) investigates the management of heart attacks. Participating hospitals and ambulance services are to provide a record of their management practices. These records are then compared to national and international clinical standards. The National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) is a partnership of clinicians, IT experts, analysts, academics and managers. Its mission is to &ldquo;provide information to improve heart disease patients&#8217; quality of care and outcomes&rdquo;. Using different audits, MINAP being one of them, NICOR aims to provide the NHS, government and regulatory bodies real world data to be used in patient care. The team&rsquo;s primary point of contact is the Project Manager for MINAP, who we have referred to as the &lsquo;client&rsquo; in previous posts.</p>

<h3>Our Project: A mobile solution</h3>

<p>Participating facilities are requested to enter all patients with suspected heart attack. Data is collected by nurses and other clinical audit staff and entered in a dedicated web application. This web application collects all patient data, from demographics to diagnosis and release information. As it stands, the web application contains a 130 field dataset that is updated every two years (latest revision, June 2013). The data is then validated against a set of rules which include, but are not limited to, value range checks, date range checks, data type checks and encryption rules. Once completed, records are stored on MINAP&rsquo;s Domino server. A further look into the web application will be posted in a later post.</p>

<p>The app dev team has been tasked to produce a mobile application that will serve as a starting point for the data capture process, thus relieving clinicians of some of the burden of data entry. This project will retain the major functionality of the web application while working with a slightly reduced dataset. Validation and storage must be taken into account, as well as maintaining a semblance of familiarity for the current user base. The target platform for this mobile solution is the Android OS for smartphones.</p>

		<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 25th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The App Dev team decided it would be in everyone&rsquo;s best interest if no coding took place the day after the University&rsquo;s deadline. Instead, the team looked ahead to the second deadline three weeks away. Wiki resources were updated, Milestone 2 requirements were read and understood. Finally, we presented our client with a possible survey to be used for data gathering / analytics.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 26th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Per our client&rsquo;s wishes, the dataset has been reduced to 60 fields from 130 fields. The team first fleshed out how these reduced dataset would interact within the application. Abstraction was taken into account as all most of these fields would require alike functionality.</p>

<p>After separating the fields into logical &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; the meeting focused on the transition from Java coding to integrating SQL and XML into the product&rsquo;s code.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 27th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team reviewed extra documents from client that further helped with dataset rules. Sample decisions trees were sketched as per the new validation logic. Meeting was adjourned after an email to client with some questions for clarifications was sent.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 28th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The client&rsquo;s reply cleared all questions from previous meeting. After discussing this new information, the team focused on University tasks, namely the GC02 poster that would be due next Wednesday (the 4th).</p>

<p>After a brief discussion. It was decided that meetings for Friday and the weekend (the 29th through Dec 1st) would be unnecessary. As such, the team divvied up work packages to clear during these days including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making sure Java validation works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure XML parsing works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure SQL connection / read / write capabilities work on a command line level</li>
<li>Further insight into Android programming, HCI requirements</li>
</ul>

		<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 18th</h3>

<hr />

<p>As the first milestone draws close, the team started the meeting with a review of the project&rsquo;s specifications both from the client and from the University. We then moved to advance the parts that were lacking. Use cases were tabulated. Further git run-throughs were underway. Finally, our latest meeting with our client was transcribed and questions and answers were extracted from it.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 19th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entire team concentrated on coding.</p>

<p>It was deemed one more client meeting was needed before sending in the project for marking. The team wrote down all questions that may have been left out of previous communications as well as drafting out a survey prototype per client&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>Meeting was adjourned after considering a Gantt chart for drafting out the schedule of the work packages.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 20th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Our meeting with our client and the web application&rsquo;s developer went as expected. We followed up with the developer on some clarification due to the complexities of both our project and the existing web app.</p>

<p>Once again, the team checked the project&rsquo;s specifications and listed the yet unfinished sections.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 21st through Sunday Nov. 24th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team worked throughout the rest of the week on any and all missing sections of the project.</p>

<p>Coding took place throughout most of these four days. During coding breaks, the team worked on the project report, Gantt chart, data dictionary, or UML specifications.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 24th, at 4:52 P.M., the team gathered all it sources and turned the project in for marking.</p>

		<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 11</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entirety of today&rsquo;s meeting was given to the development of an XML structure for the application. While an XML schema was previously designed, actual coding proved problematic.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 12</h3>

<hr />

<p>As with yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, the team continued to work on an XML solution.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, there may be a different way to get the Domino side of the client&rsquo;s application to the product.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 13</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting was less formal. XML continues to be worked on. The team requested a meeting with the client in order to present early GUI designs and, if possible, speak to the current application&rsquo;s developer. The client soon set a meeting for Friday 15th.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 14</h3>

<hr />

<p>XML was set aside for this meeting as the team focused on getting a better grip on the GUI designs as well as developing questions and talking points for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting with the client.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 15</h3>

<hr />

<p>Meeting with client.</p>

<p>While the majority of the GUI design was deemed appropriate, a navigation screen will likely have to be entirely redesigned as it could prove unwieldy for handheld platforms.</p>

<p>The client also provided further insight to the processes behind the current application in use as well as the background of the client&rsquo;s company. Unfortunately, the current application&rsquo;s developer was not able to join the team. A meeting has been set for Tuesday 19th.</p>

<p>The team also agreed to help develop a survey to find the extent of the usefulness of the proposed product as well as to provide further information about use cases for the current application.</p>

<p>The app dev team will complete University tasks for the product during the weekend and start the coding process on Monday 18th.</p>

		<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 4</h3>

<hr />

<p>Working off Friday&rsquo;s rough sketch, the app dev team fleshed out the specifications for the product. Architectural Decisions were put in place as well as a Client &ndash; Server interaction diagram.</p>

<p>The team then moved on to decide the structure of the XML files that will be used in the product&rsquo;s backend SQL Database. The frontend was also touched upon as GUIs were sketched and then integrated into the model.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 5</h3>

<hr />

<p>The software Domingo was seen as a plausible option to network the client&rsquo;s Domino server to the app team&rsquo;s Java product. A short run-through at the beginning of this day quickly showed that more information would be needed.</p>

<p>The app dev team then proceeded to install and familiarize themselves with GitHub and its workings related to both Eclipse and other application.</p>

<p>The bulk of the meeting was then spent on converting Monday&rsquo;s sketches into classes and deciding how these mock Classes would interact with each other based on the current software&rsquo;s documents provided by the client. Along the way, the team encountered some unclear points that were, at the end of the meeting, communicated to the client asking for clarification.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 6</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting started with a discussion of the requirements for this project as outlined in the University&rsquo;s email. It was deemed that the app dev team was on the right track as per said requirements. This was followed by discussing the client&rsquo;s reply to the previous meeting&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Clarifications noted, the team moved on to set up a collaborative coding environment. The applications Trello, WeChat and WindowBuilder for Eclipse were installed on the necessary terminals for each team member. Team roles were also assigned.</p>

<p>Class construction followed. Possible methods for classes were discussed and written down. Inheritance was discussed and XML configuration was delved further into.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 7</h3>

<hr />

<p>The meeting started with some further discussion into Domingo and the possible limitations of it. The JDBC Java library was then seen into as a possible way to have the XML configuration files &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the SQL end of the product.</p>

<p>Logical steps for the product were then discussed; from communication with the Domino server, to the display of a GUI on the chosen platform and back to the Domino server as a write operation.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 8</h3>

<hr />

<p>Domingo has proven to be unrealiable as a solution to the team&rsquo;s need for a way to communicate with the client&rsquo;s Domino server. A different way to meet this goal must be found.</p>

<p>The app dev team then agreed to hold the next meeting on Monday the 11th</p>
