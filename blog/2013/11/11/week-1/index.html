	<div class="entry-content"><h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 4</h3>

<hr />

<p>Working off Friday&rsquo;s rough sketch, the app dev team fleshed out the specifications for the product. Architectural Decisions were put in place as well as a Client &ndash; Server interaction diagram.</p>

<p>The team then moved on to decide the structure of the XML files that will be used in the product&rsquo;s backend SQL Database. The frontend was also touched upon as GUIs were sketched and then integrated into the model.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 5</h3>

<hr />

<p>The software Domingo was seen as a plausible option to network the client&rsquo;s Domino server to the app team&rsquo;s Java product. A short run-through at the beginning of this day quickly showed that more information would be needed.</p>

<p>The app dev team then proceeded to install and familiarize themselves with GitHub and its workings related to both Eclipse and other application.</p>

<p>The bulk of the meeting was then spent on converting Monday&rsquo;s sketches into classes and deciding how these mock Classes would interact with each other based on the current software&rsquo;s documents provided by the client. Along the way, the team encountered some unclear points that were, at the end of the meeting, communicated to the client asking for clarification.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 6</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting started with a discussion of the requirements for this project as outlined in the University&rsquo;s email. It was deemed that the app dev team was on the right track as per said requirements. This was followed by discussing the client&rsquo;s reply to the previous meeting&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Clarifications noted, the team moved on to set up a collaborative coding environment. The applications Trello, WeChat and WindowBuilder for Eclipse were installed on the necessary terminals for each team member. Team roles were also assigned.</p>

<p>Class construction followed. Possible methods for classes were discussed and written down. Inheritance was discussed and XML configuration was delved further into.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 7</h3>

<hr />

<p>The meeting started with some further discussion into Domingo and the possible limitations of it. The JDBC Java library was then seen into as a possible way to have the XML configuration files &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the SQL end of the product.</p>

<p>Logical steps for the product were then discussed; from communication with the Domino server, to the display of a GUI on the chosen platform and back to the Domino server as a write operation.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 8</h3>

<hr />

<p>Domingo has proven to be unrealiable as a solution to the team&rsquo;s need for a way to communicate with the client&rsquo;s Domino server. A different way to meet this goal must be found.</p>

<p>The app dev team then agreed to hold the next meeting on Monday the 11th</p>
