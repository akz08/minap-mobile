    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Current Solution Analysis</h3>

<p>MINAP&rsquo;s participants use a web application for data capture. The web application is limited in its use to the Windows platform as well as to the Internet Explorer (ver 9 and below) web browser. While hospitals and clinics have this in mind, and thus have their equipment ready for these limitations, newer participants may need to go out of their way to accommodate MINAP&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<h3>Logging in</h3>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/login.png" title="Login Screen" ></p>

<p>Authorised users are given a set of credentials unique to them. These credentials then create a session that keeps track of both the user and the user&rsquo;s workplace throughout the data capture process and are automatically filled in to the appropriate fields in the web application.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/legal.png" title="Legal Start Screen" ></p>

<p>If the user&rsquo;s log in details are cleared against MINAP&rsquo;s users database, a legal disclaimer page will be shown in order to protect the sensitive data about to be used.</p>

<h3>Data Capture</h3>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/initial-diagnosis.png" title="Initial Diagnosis Screen" ></p>

<p>Data Capture itself can take several minutes to an hour depending on the patient&rsquo;s information. The navigation buttons along the left side of the screen are of no concern for this project. The right side of the screen will display the patient&rsquo;s demographic information as well as identifying the user that created the record in use across the top half.</p>

<p>Each pages&#8217; bottom half will display the controls necessary to capture the patient&rsquo;s information. Controls that may be used include (but are not limited to) text fields, buttons, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and calendar input boxes. Data validation can happen once exiting the particular field or page, or when saving the record. In addition each field contains a tool tip for the information that it captures as well as the corresponding field number in MINAP&rsquo;s dataset.</p>

<p>Navigation-wise, each page has at least three buttons: &ldquo;Save&rdquo; places all data onto a permanent record (it will not, however, navigate or indicate in any way that the saving has taken place); &ldquo;Close&rdquo; will end the data capture without saving progress (a message box will inform the user of this), the user will then be directed to a listing of all patients entered into the system. The other three buttons: &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, &ldquo;Back&rdquo; and what MINAP refers to as the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; need further looking into.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/compass-screen.png" title="Compass Screen" ></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is, in essence, a navigation map. Pressing this button will bring the user to a flow-diagram-like display of the pages that are available for data capture. The user can then navigate directly to the page desired provided it is available. If the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is not used, the web app has a linear way of navigating through screens. &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will fulfill the expected functions in this linear way. It should be noted that if the user accessed a page via the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; page, pressing &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will not bring up the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo;, but the page that precedes the current display in the previously mentioned linear navigation.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that throughout the data capture process, the decisions made across certain field or fields will trigger the appearance of one or more fields and even entire pages for further capture.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>While the web app MINAP currently uses has served its purpose, it could stand to receive an update. There are areas that are no longer obscure to its users only because of their current use of the app. As a group, we had a tough time getting to know the finer details of the system and even our client had to, at times, consul with her coworkers in order to answer some of out questions.</p>

<p>In our solution, we must do away with as many of these gray areas and make our solution as intuitive as possible without losing major functionality.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to get a better grasp on the usability and usage of the project. The team would like to introduce our persona, Julie.</p>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<p>Julie is a 28-year-old Nurse working in the General Hospital (MINAP Code: YYY). She is in charge of admitting and taking care of all types of patients at General Hospital.</p>

<p>Due to budget constraints, Julie cares for multiple patients at the same time gathering data for other organizations in addition to MINAP. Since entering a patient&rsquo;s data for MINAP&rsquo;s web application requires being physically in front of a computer as well as time to complete the record, Julie finds the whole process &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Julie is tech-savvy in that she owns a smartphone, she has never used it for work, though. However, as she has some time with the patient while they are being admitted, Julie wonders if she could at least flag the patient for later input to MINAP&rsquo;s database through her smartphone.</p>

<p>As she checks in a new patient, Julie wonders&hellip; &ldquo;Is there an app for that?&rdquo;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 25th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The App Dev team decided it would be in everyone&rsquo;s best interest if no coding took place the day after the University&rsquo;s deadline. Instead, the team looked ahead to the second deadline three weeks away. Wiki resources were updated, Milestone 2 requirements were read and understood. Finally, we presented our client with a possible survey to be used for data gathering / analytics.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 26th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Per our client&rsquo;s wishes, the dataset has been reduced to 60 fields from 130 fields. The team first fleshed out how these reduced dataset would interact within the application. Abstraction was taken into account as all most of these fields would require alike functionality.</p>

<p>After separating the fields into logical &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; the meeting focused on the transition from Java coding to integrating SQL and XML into the product&rsquo;s code.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 27th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team reviewed extra documents from client that further helped with dataset rules. Sample decisions trees were sketched as per the new validation logic. Meeting was adjourned after an email to client with some questions for clarifications was sent.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 28th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The client&rsquo;s reply cleared all questions from previous meeting. After discussing this new information, the team focused on University tasks, namely the GC02 poster that would be due next Wednesday (the 4th).</p>

<p>After a brief discussion. It was decided that meetings for Friday and the weekend (the 29th through Dec 1st) would be unnecessary. As such, the team divvied up work packages to clear during these days including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making sure Java validation works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure XML parsing works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure SQL connection / read / write capabilities work on a command line level</li>
<li>Further insight into Android programming, HCI requirements</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 18th</h3>

<hr />

<p>As the first milestone draws close, the team started the meeting with a review of the project&rsquo;s specifications both from the client and from the University. We then moved to advance the parts that were lacking. Use cases were tabulated. Further git run-throughs were underway. Finally, our latest meeting with our client was transcribed and questions and answers were extracted from it.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 19th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entire team concentrated on coding.</p>

<p>It was deemed one more client meeting was needed before sending in the project for marking. The team wrote down all questions that may have been left out of previous communications as well as drafting out a survey prototype per client&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>Meeting was adjourned after considering a Gantt chart for drafting out the schedule of the work packages.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 20th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Our meeting with our client and the web application&rsquo;s developer went as expected. We followed up with the developer on some clarification due to the complexities of both our project and the existing web app.</p>

<p>Once again, the team checked the project&rsquo;s specifications and listed the yet unfinished sections.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 21st through Sunday Nov. 24th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team worked throughout the rest of the week on any and all missing sections of the project.</p>

<p>Coding took place throughout most of these four days. During coding breaks, the team worked on the project report, Gantt chart, data dictionary, or UML specifications.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 24th, at 4:52 P.M., the team gathered all it sources and turned the project in for marking.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 11</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entirety of today&rsquo;s meeting was given to the development of an XML structure for the application. While an XML schema was previously designed, actual coding proved problematic.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 12</h3>

<hr />

<p>As with yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, the team continued to work on an XML solution.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, there may be a different way to get the Domino side of the client&rsquo;s application to the product.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 13</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting was less formal. XML continues to be worked on. The team requested a meeting with the client in order to present early GUI designs and, if possible, speak to the current application&rsquo;s developer. The client soon set a meeting for Friday 15th.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 14</h3>

<hr />

<p>XML was set aside for this meeting as the team focused on getting a better grip on the GUI designs as well as developing questions and talking points for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting with the client.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 15</h3>

<hr />

<p>Meeting with client.</p>

<p>While the majority of the GUI design was deemed appropriate, a navigation screen will likely have to be entirely redesigned as it could prove unwieldy for handheld platforms.</p>

<p>The client also provided further insight to the processes behind the current application in use as well as the background of the client&rsquo;s company. Unfortunately, the current application&rsquo;s developer was not able to join the team. A meeting has been set for Tuesday 19th.</p>

<p>The team also agreed to help develop a survey to find the extent of the usefulness of the proposed product as well as to provide further information about use cases for the current application.</p>

<p>The app dev team will complete University tasks for the product during the weekend and start the coding process on Monday 18th.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 4</h3>

<hr />

<p>Working off Friday&rsquo;s rough sketch, the app dev team fleshed out the specifications for the product. Architectural Decisions were put in place as well as a Client &ndash; Server interaction diagram.</p>

<p>The team then moved on to decide the structure of the XML files that will be used in the product&rsquo;s backend SQL Database. The frontend was also touched upon as GUIs were sketched and then integrated into the model.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 5</h3>

<hr />

<p>The software Domingo was seen as a plausible option to network the client&rsquo;s Domino server to the app team&rsquo;s Java product. A short run-through at the beginning of this day quickly showed that more information would be needed.</p>

<p>The app dev team then proceeded to install and familiarize themselves with GitHub and its workings related to both Eclipse and other application.</p>

<p>The bulk of the meeting was then spent on converting Monday&rsquo;s sketches into classes and deciding how these mock Classes would interact with each other based on the current software&rsquo;s documents provided by the client. Along the way, the team encountered some unclear points that were, at the end of the meeting, communicated to the client asking for clarification.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 6</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting started with a discussion of the requirements for this project as outlined in the University&rsquo;s email. It was deemed that the app dev team was on the right track as per said requirements. This was followed by discussing the client&rsquo;s reply to the previous meeting&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Clarifications noted, the team moved on to set up a collaborative coding environment. The applications Trello, WeChat and WindowBuilder for Eclipse were installed on the necessary terminals for each team member. Team roles were also assigned.</p>

<p>Class construction followed. Possible methods for classes were discussed and written down. Inheritance was discussed and XML configuration was delved further into.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 7</h3>

<hr />

<p>The meeting started with some further discussion into Domingo and the possible limitations of it. The JDBC Java library was then seen into as a possible way to have the XML configuration files &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the SQL end of the product.</p>

<p>Logical steps for the product were then discussed; from communication with the Domino server, to the display of a GUI on the chosen platform and back to the Domino server as a write operation.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 8</h3>

<hr />

<p>Domingo has proven to be unrealiable as a solution to the team&rsquo;s need for a way to communicate with the client&rsquo;s Domino server. A different way to meet this goal must be found.</p>

<p>The app dev team then agreed to hold the next meeting on Monday the 11th</p>
