    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following evaluation is based on Nielsenâ€™s 10 principles of heuristic evaluation:</p>

<h3>Visibility of system status (Feedback)</h3>

<p>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</p>

<h4>Selection</h4>

<p>The box that was clicked by user will be highlighted with blue line, makes it easier for user to know where they have selected</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-selection.jpg" title="Selection" ></p>

<h4>Save indicator</h4>

<p>A feedback message is displayed when an action is performed, in case, when save button is clicked, the app will save completed fields and give feedback to user.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-save.jpg" title="Save" ></p>

<h3>Match between system and the real world(METHAPHOR)</h3>

<p>The system should speak the users&#8217; language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</p>

<p>The design of navigation page on the app is very similar to the one that the current MINAP web solution has, expect the simplified structure, the essential feature which is the tree diagram was kept, and the logical relations between pages are inherited as well. For those who are new to our app, they can easily find their way by using the familiar navigation page.</p>

<p>Navigation page on the old web solution</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-system-2.jpg" title="Web app" ></p>

<h3>User control and freedom (NAVIGATION)</h3>

<p>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &ldquo;emergency exit&rdquo; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</p>

<p>The app provides excellent navigation supports. Both an easy navigation side bar and a navigation page are offered to user. For those who are new to our app, they can easily find their way by using the familiar navigation page, for those who want quickly switch from page to page, the navigation bar will meet their need.</p>

<p>The navigation page</p>

<p>The navigation bar</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-control-2.jpg" title="Navigation drawer" ></p>

<h3>Consistency and standards</h3>

<p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>

<h4>Input method</h4>

<p>In order to make the user as comfortable as possible, the app inherited the way user input the information from the old web solution, the ratio button, drop down list, the types of the fields were all kept as they were.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-consistency.jpg" title="Input methods" ></p>

<h3>Error prevention</h3>

<p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</p>

<p>The log out and create new record functions both will discard the current record, in order to prevent user mistakenly touched those buttons and lose their input, a warming sign will pop up to confirm whether user wants to proceed.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-error.jpg" title="Error handling" ></p>

<h3>Recognition rather than recall</h3>

<p>Minimize the user&rsquo;s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</p>

<p>In case the user need help with understanding certain fields, most of the fields are come with notes, if you click the exclamation mark next to the field name, the note which contains explanation for the field will appear.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/ke-recog.jpg" title="Recognition" ></p>

<h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>

<p>Accelerators &mdash; unseen by the novice user &mdash; may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p>

<p>The reason why the app has two navigation methods is not only the new user could get use to the app very quickly(with navigation page), but also those experienced user, who wants be more efferent, could switch from page to page more quickly(with navigation bar).</p>

    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2014/01/21/davids-heuristic-evaluation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Throughout this project, I&rsquo;ve been mostly involved with the back-end logic and design, and though my &ldquo;share&rdquo; has its importance, in the end it is the user interface that will be presented to our end users. Having said that, using the mobile application was, for this particular user, a painless experience.</p>

<p>There is familiarity in the way the application is presented. As of this writing, our application is not complete; yet I can&rsquo;t help but make parallels between the existing web application and our solution. The way input is asked from the user is identical on both applications: radio buttons, drop-down lists, text / date fields are all included, work and (for the most part, given the reduced working space) are presented in the same order. Functionally, our solution works as the web application does. A record needs only four fields be filled in order to be saved, but provides enough fields to complete six full information pages.</p>

<p>The overall design of our solution is, for lack of a better term, aesthetically sound. There are no elements that go unused or misused, everything on the screen is there for a clear reason. Furthermore, the design is clean. Colours are used sparingly, but contrast well when needed (especially on radio button selection).</p>

<p>Navigation has remained faithful to the web application as well. Next and Back buttons work on our app as they do online, keeping a linear approach. Yet the addition of a drawer navigation object will allow for faster navigation and data input for those users that may be more experienced than most. Slight reminders or visual cues, the clearest one being having to scroll down to the end of the page in order to continue, make for a more user friendly experience.</p>

<p>As a final note, it should be pointed out that this application is meant for medical professionals. As such, terminology is not suited for all users. Tooltips also will only help those that are familiar with MINAP and their web application.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Standing on the shoulders</h3>

<p>During the early development phases, David made several sketches of a preliminary UI to show to our client to ensure we had captured all the functionality that we had agreed on. The focus was more on functionality, rather than specific UI decisions, since we had yet to nail down our target mobile platform. The client was happy with our design decisions &ndash; with some suggestions for functionality &ndash; but our requirements have significantly changed since then, and we now have a mobile platform that we have decided to stick to (Android). Despite this, much of the new UI design is based off these preliminary sketches.
<img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/david-paper-ui.png" title="One of David's preliminary UI sketches" ></p>

<h3>New beginnings</h3>

<p>To help with the redesign, I took over the process of creating the new GUI, and started off with a clean slate (piece of paper).</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/blank-sheet.JPG" title="Blank page template" ></p>

<p>I printed out several templates (made in MS Word) around the size of a typical Android smartphone&rsquo;s screen to keep myself within the constraints of a phone. The black bar at the bottom is meant to represent Android&rsquo;s &ldquo;soft buttons&rdquo; for navigation on newer phones without menu keys built into the hardware (as seen on the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/ui-overview.html" title="Android Navigation Bar">developer website under the heading &ldquo;System Bars&rdquo;</a>). For this case, phones with the soft navigation bar primarily differ from older phones (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S" title="Nexus S">Nexus S</a>) in that they move the roles of the hardware &ldquo;menu&rdquo; button to an &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; soft-button on the Android action bar. I assumed the newer behaviour when designing the interface.</p>

<h3>First steps</h3>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/19/android-ui-elements/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-19T14:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/19/android-ui-elements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve owned an Android smartphone for three years before switching over to a hand-me-down iPhone, and went through Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich(4.0). Having spent the first 2 years dealing with Gingerbread, switching to the new interface of Android 4.0 was a breath of fresh air. ICS introduced a cleaner UI with a clearer design language. Our decision to only support devices from ICS onwards are primarily due to security concerns, but the availability of more (intuitive) UI elements and ways to present our app is really just the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>To get a clearer idea of the UI elements available to us, I had a look through the official Android UI website, identifying the main elements available for use. This was just a very brief run through, as I realised the documentation regarding the recommended use of the elements by Google were quite thorough &ndash; which I intend to constantly refer to throughout the building of the app UI.</p>

<p>Platform specific UI patterns of interest (images taken from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/index.html">Android developer website</a>:</p>

<h4>Action Bar</h4>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/action_bar_basics.png" title="Action Bar image from the Android Developer website" >
The action bar acts as a persistent UI pattern that can be used across all pages. Less important functionality such as Logging out could be kept in the &lsquo;overflow&rsquo; (3 vertical dots) menu, and key features such as saving could use prominent icons (the classical floppy disk). The icon (labelled 1) for ancestral navigation could also be made contextual, such that it could change to be a compass icon when the user navigates to a data entry page.</p>

<h4>Navigation drawer</h4>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/navigation_drawer_overview.png" title="Navigation Drawer image from the Android Developer website" >
Our mobile app&rsquo;s key purpose is to allow for quick data collection at the point of contact with the patient. With tech savvy users such as Julie, we would like to include as many time-saving shortcuts to frequently accessed features as possible. The navigation drawer could be introduced as an alternative way to navigate around the pages, as opposed to constantly visiting the navigation map. The typical way of navigation (according to our client) involves the user &lsquo;hopping&rsquo; around different pages when entering information (making the back and next buttons redundant &ndash; but we are keeping them for familiarity). A good use of the drawer would be to allow quick navigation around pages, as well as maybe giving the user feedback on who they are logged in as, and who the current patient being recorded is.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-19T14:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/19/android-design</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To create a truly native application that users of the mobile platform can easily navigate, I figured that I needed to understand the common design language of the operating system (OS). So in preparation for mapping information and navigation of the current MINAP web app onto Android, I had a look through the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html">official design principles of Android OS</a>. At first glance, the Android design principles don&rsquo;t seem to relate to our medical data entry app at all (&ldquo;delight me in surprising ways&rdquo;?), but specific points can be picked out. From the three main principles (Enchant me, Simplify my life, Make me amazing), some outlined sub-principles of the document can be taken onboard in the design of the app:</p>

<h3>Simplify My Life</h3>

<h4>Keep it brief:</h4>

<p>Although the core content of the app cannot be changed due to the precise nature of medical data input, we can keep our tutorials short with simple language</p>

<h4>Only show what I need when I need it:</h4>

<p>Breaking down the tasks of using the application strikes me as an area which we could improve on the current app, with a wealth of possible options available to me upon opening the web app. If we expect the app to have more widespread usage, the process of record creation should be fairly intuitive to someone with limited prior knowledge.</p>

<h4>I should always know where I am:</h4>

<p>There are two main &lsquo;modes&rsquo; which our user would be most active in during use: navigation mode, and page data entry mode. It should be clear how the user will navigate back and forth through the app, allowing for multiple possible ways (i.e. back button, or a navigator icon)</p>

<h4>Never lose my stuff:</h4>

<p>Due to security concerns and data protection, we shouldn&rsquo;t retain a local copy of entered data beyond the duration of the session. Despite this, we could &lsquo;autosave&rsquo; the entered data into a &lsquo;draft&rsquo; database on the central server, with visual indicators to let the user know the data has been submitted for storing (the expected web app behaviour is manual saving).</p>

<h4>If it looks the same, it should act the same:</h4>

<p>We should keep in mind what we mean when using Android UI elements (i.e. if it looks like a text box, it should act like one) to ensure they retain the same meaning throughout the app.</p>

<h3>Make Me Amazing</h3>

<h4>Give me tricks that work everywhere:</h4>

<p>Gestures such as swiping from the edge for menus aren&rsquo;t good for a primary interface due to discoverability issues for novice users, but can serve to speed up the workflow of more experienced users.</p>

<h4>It&rsquo;s not my fault:</h4>

<p>When informing the user of validation errors, it would be helpful to consider if the warnings could be reworded for clarity and &lsquo;niceness&rsquo;.</p>

<h4>Make important things fast:</h4>

<p>The ability to switch between pages and the mode of data entry and navigation should be effortless. It should also be relatively easy to check details of the session such as the current logged in username and patient core details.</p>

<p>To make UI decisions easier, I will be aiming to follow these principles as closely as possible in conjunction with the core Android UI elements and more detailed design guidelines which I hope to cover in a future post.</p>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/17/finding-competition/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-17T14:01:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/17/finding-competition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Medical data entry applications are a new concept (and also likely to be distributed solely within the company), so direct competitors are hard to come by on all major mobile app stores. One element of our app solution that could be used as a basis for finding similar solutions is the navigation panel. On a 1024 x 768 desktop browser, the user can easily read all the text and possible pathways at a glance. Directly mapping this onto a small device (smartphone) would yield unreadable text if naively shrunk to fit the screen; enabling a simple zoom-in and out approach would require too much scrolling in arbitrary directions to view the complete navigation map.</p>

<p>To get some ideas on how we could best represent this tree-navigation structure, we had a look through the apps on our own smartphones. Interestingly enough, a language learning app had the closest representation of the current MINAP navigation tree.</p>

<h3>Duolingo</h3>

<p>Duolingo, a language learning mobile app, relies on a central &lsquo;learning tree&rsquo; to show the user&rsquo;s progress of language learning. The user progresses through different levels, clearly separated by horizontal rules, containing individual units of activities.
<img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/duolingo-main.png" title="Duolingo main screen" ></p>

<p>Each unit is an icon, associated with a short description of its associated meaning. Colour is used to signify the ability to access the units: with greyscale to mean inactive, and a coloured icon to mean active. User progress in the units are indicated as well, through use of fractions and &lsquo;level bars&rsquo; (which is puzzling), using colours and greyscale again to indicate level of completeness. As with most modern designs, Duolingo has done away with scroll bars to signify the ability to scroll downwards, but overcomes this problem by having an icon &lsquo;peeking&rsquo; out from the bottom of the screen &ndash; indicating that there is more content below.</p>

<p>Due to the working environment that our app would be used in, we need to ensure a professional look &ndash; so we can&rsquo;t use vibrant colours and iconography as extensively as Duolingo. However, the use of very distinct colours to indicate level of completeness and access could be adopted for quick recognition of the completion &lsquo;status&rsquo; of each page on the navigation map, to suit the quick nature of patient record creation intended in our mobile app. The current (MINAP) web app employs the same colouring strategy, though using more subtle hues, compatible with the more relaxed and slow process of data entry at the computer.</p>

<p>Additionally, the organisation of levels in Duolingo lack a sense of coherence, with the utilitarian grey divider not conveying any sign of connection between the different levels. The MINAP web app has the problem of dealing with &lsquo;levels&rsquo; containing up to 7 pages, which unfortunately won&rsquo;t fit with Duolingo&rsquo;s method of mapping.</p>

<h3>Reddit Sync</h3>

<p>Reddit Sync is a (3rd-party) mobile client app for a popular online community sharing website, Reddit. Its primary purpose is for consuming content quickly and giving feedback on posted content by votes or comments. The app makes heavy use of the card metaphor, with card metadata and actionable items prominently featured.
<img class="left" src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/reddit-sync-main.png" title="Reddit Sync main screen" ></p>

<p>What I found most interesting about Reddit Sync however, was its use of the Android navigation drawer. Reddit is divided into separate interest groups/sections called &lsquo;subreddits&rsquo;, which contain posts related to a particular topic. These sections are analogous to the pages in the MINAP dataset, and could be used as a quick alternative way (a navigation list) to traverse through the many pages.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/sync-drawer.png" title="Reddit Sync navigation drawer" ></p>

<p>One other interesting feature is how the app deals with multiple logins. It is common practice on Reddit for users to manage multiple accounts for their different online personas. Reddit Sync prominently displays your currently logged in username at the top of the navigation drawer, with a &lsquo;spinner&rsquo; &ndash; an Android signifier indicating the ability to choose between several options. Touching this spinner allows the user to switch between accounts on the fly. Such an interface could be useful in the near future to allow MINAP users to switch between accounts registered to different hospitals under their name.

    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/16/platform-choice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For our MINAP mobile application, we have chosen to go with the Android mobile platform. One of the main reasons behind this choice of platform (as opposed to the option of creating a mobile web app) was due to the <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/space/" title="Sencha Space">issues of security</a> if the app is developed further in the future for actual use in the hospital. A native application would be the ideal choice, to ensure full utilisation of the platform&rsquo;s security features.</p>

<p>A bonus of choosing the Android platform (or any native platform, really) helps lock down the user interface to the design standards in place, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Most apps would conform to these standards, and so it would help with reducing the cognitive load when learning to use our mobile app.</p>

<p>Although this would mean a departure from the current web app&rsquo;s structure (programming-wise), the benefits of following UI standards and security will hopefully far outweigh the initial cost of time (and effort) in programming.</p>

    <link href="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/16/looking-deeper/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-16T14:01:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/16/looking-deeper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From the previous blog post, we can see that the current web app page flow can be modelled into a simple page navigation flow, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/page-navigation-flow.png" title="Page Navigation Flow" ></p>

<p>This interface flow diagram maps the current flow of use in the web app, with the exception of a new page addition &ndash; patient details. Patient details are currently displayed on each page in the web app, reminding the user who the current patient being entered into the database is. For mobile, we would need to separate this section into its own page due to size constraints. The downside of doing this, would mean that there would be no feedback on the page to remind the user of the current patient details &ndash; something that needs to be addressed when the UI is more thoroughly fleshed out.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/patient-details.png" title="Patient Details" ></p>

<p>We will keep the current web app&rsquo;s navigation behaviour and visual signifiers (usage of back, next, and compass icon) for consistency across the whole system, to ensure that existing users can use their preexisting mental model for the mobile app.</p>

<p>Beyond the navigation flow, the MINAP web app makes use of question mark icons ( ? ) as points of help for the user (e.g. clicking on the ( ? ) icon next to the value &ldquo;Administrative Status&rdquo; will open a dialog box containing help relevant to the input box)</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/help-box.png" title="Help Box" ></p>

<p>Our mobile app will also retain these help icons and dialog boxes, ensuring the user can obtain help within the data collection process, whenever there is relevant information to display &ndash; especially since our mobile app would ideally be used by a far wider audience than the current web app.</p>

<p>Not shown in the flow diagram (for simplicity&rsquo;s sake) is the ability to log out from every page (with the exception of the log in page), and the ability to save. The save icon should be prominently be displayed on each value page, though the log out button can possibly be hidden from view for small screen sizes.</p>

<p>To get a better idea on just how we can represent these functions, we would need to further explore the visual affordances provided to us by our target mobile platform to ensure consistency across their app ecosystem.</p>

    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/15/looking-inside</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Current Solution Analysis</h3>

<p>MINAP&rsquo;s participants use a web application for data capture. The web application is limited in its use to the Windows platform as well as to the Internet Explorer (ver 9 and below) web browser. While hospitals and clinics have this in mind, and thus have their equipment ready for these limitations, newer participants may need to go out of their way to accommodate MINAP&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<h3>Logging in</h3>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/login.png" title="Login Screen" ></p>

<p>Authorised users are given a set of credentials unique to them. These credentials then create a session that keeps track of both the user and the user&rsquo;s workplace throughout the data capture process and are automatically filled in to the appropriate fields in the web application.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/legal.png" title="Legal Start Screen" ></p>

<p>If the user&rsquo;s log in details are cleared against MINAP&rsquo;s users database, a legal disclaimer page will be shown in order to protect the sensitive data about to be used.</p>

<h3>Data Capture</h3>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/initial-diagnosis.png" title="Initial Diagnosis Screen" ></p>

<p>Data Capture itself can take several minutes to an hour depending on the patient&rsquo;s information. The navigation buttons along the left side of the screen are of no concern for this project. The right side of the screen will display the patient&rsquo;s demographic information as well as identifying the user that created the record in use across the top half.</p>

<p>Each pages&#8217; bottom half will display the controls necessary to capture the patient&rsquo;s information. Controls that may be used include (but are not limited to) text fields, buttons, radio buttons, dropdown lists, and calendar input boxes. Data validation can happen once exiting the particular field or page, or when saving the record. In addition each field contains a tool tip for the information that it captures as well as the corresponding field number in MINAP&rsquo;s dataset.</p>

<p>Navigation-wise, each page has at least three buttons: &ldquo;Save&rdquo; places all data onto a permanent record (it will not, however, navigate or indicate in any way that the saving has taken place); &ldquo;Close&rdquo; will end the data capture without saving progress (a message box will inform the user of this), the user will then be directed to a listing of all patients entered into the system. The other three buttons: &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, &ldquo;Back&rdquo; and what MINAP refers to as the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; need further looking into.</p>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/compass-screen.png" title="Compass Screen" ></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is, in essence, a navigation map. Pressing this button will bring the user to a flow-diagram-like display of the pages that are available for data capture. The user can then navigate directly to the page desired provided it is available. If the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; is not used, the web app has a linear way of navigating through screens. &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will fulfill the expected functions in this linear way. It should be noted that if the user accessed a page via the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo; page, pressing &ldquo;Back&rdquo; will not bring up the &ldquo;Compass&rdquo;, but the page that precedes the current display in the previously mentioned linear navigation.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned that throughout the data capture process, the decisions made across certain field or fields will trigger the appearance of one or more fields and even entire pages for further capture.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>While the web app MINAP currently uses has served its purpose, it could stand to receive an update. There are areas that are no longer obscure to its users only because of their current use of the app. As a group, we had a tough time getting to know the finer details of the system and even our client had to, at times, consul with her coworkers in order to answer some of out questions.</p>

<p>In our solution, we must do away with as many of these gray areas and make our solution as intuitive as possible without losing major functionality.</p>

    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/13/why-so-savvy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The two personas we&rsquo;ve introduced are pretty tech savvy, currently owning smartphones for a considerable amount of time. Where are all the non-savvy users?</p>

<p>The MINAP dataset and interface is a very complicated system to the first-time user (as we have experienced first hand), and reducing this complexity to a mobile device whilst still retaining most (if not all) the functionality of the web app is (I think) a monumental task. Whilst we will keep in mind that not all users have used smartphones before, I believe the requirement of the user having had previous experience with mobile apps is necessary to avoid them being overwhelmed by the experience of entering data into the MINAP system on a mobile device.</p>

<p>Obviously, the easiest way to mitigate this problem is to include a tutorial (which was also suggested by our client). I personally believe that most users tend to skip tutorials anyway, and that the time is better spent trying to make the app as intuitive as possible for the more experienced users. We will however provide a tutorial for our app in the near future &ndash; if time permits.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-12T11:15:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/12/meet-edward</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Why we need Edward</h3>

<p>As part of our effort to better know our end users, we ran a quick survey with our client to find out just how many MINAP users own a smartphone, and their willingness to use their personal devices for work. Our client deployed the survey via SurveyMonkey to MINAP&rsquo;s current user-base, and encouraged them to forward the link around. The survey has been running for about a week now, and will be left open for several more weeks to allow more responses, but 79 responses have been collected so far.</p>

<p>As the questions in the survey primarily involved more technical questions (such as &ldquo;what brand is your phone/tablet?&rdquo;), a more in depth commentary will be included in the report associated with this development blog. However, we have included questions such as :</p>

<blockquote><p>Do you currently use your smartphone/tablet for work-related activities during work hours? (Yes / No)</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Would you use an app on your smartphone/tablet if it helped supplement your work? (Yes / No)</p></blockquote>

<p>with a section at the end for freeform comments to allow further feedback.</p>

<p>So far, 72.4% of surveyed users responded No to using their personal devices for work-related activities, but 75.3% answered Yes to the possibility of using an app for supplementing their work. From these two responses alone, it looks like people are willing to use new technology &ndash; just not their own. The picture becomes clearer when having a look at the comments left by the users:</p>

<blockquote><p> We are not allowed to use our phones on wards so not sure how this would work. Our trust is very unlikely to buy a tablet for use by MINAP [&hellip;] If I had the equipment and an App available, I would be very happy to use it.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p> I would be more than willing to use a smartphone / table for work related activities if it was provided by work. Currently I use a personal iPhone only and would breach confidentiality / clinical governance issues if this was used for work related activities.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Any devices used in the workplace would have to be procured by our IM&amp;T Dept.</p></blockquote>

<p>show obvious concerns with regards to data protection and security, preventing the use of personal devices for work from both a personal and work perspective.</p>

<p>This is a key factor that has convinced us to ensure that our application will <em>not</em> be used in any real-life setting until a proper security audit has been performed. However, from a usability perspective, we need to ensure that users concerned about security are being reminded that the data entered into our mobile app is stored, transmitted, and securely deleted from the device when completing a record.</p>

<p>To help remind us of this issue, we have created Edward &ndash; a security conscious 30 year old clinician. Unlike Julie, who was born of feedback from the client, Edward reflects the more privacy-concerned users.</p>

<h3>So who is Edward anyway?</h3>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/300/200" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<ul>
<li>(extremely) tech savvy single 30 year old clinician</li>
<li>owns a (personal) tablet and smartphone</li>
<li>enjoys a good work-life balance</li>
<li>frequent reader of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></li>
<li>works in a hospital trust on a tight budget</li>
<li>loves efficiency</li>
<li>is professional with his patients, and respects their privacy</li>
<li>constantly saves his work and is meticulous with organising files</li>
</ul>


<p>Edward would love to streamline his workflow for entering patients into the MINAP dataset, but is well aware of data privacy laws governing patient data. As such, he begrudgingly enters patients into MINAP on Internet Explorer, but knows full well of the dangers of data leaks. He checks the application privileges on his tablet and smartphone before installing any new apps, and has helped some of his friends remove obnoxious apps from their own devices. He is distrusting of how secure mobile apps are, but can see their potential as time savers at work&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to get a better grasp on the usability and usage of the project. The team would like to introduce our persona, Julie.</p>

<p><img src="http://placekitten.com/200/200" title="Place Kitten" ></p>

<p>Julie is a 28-year-old Nurse working in the General Hospital (MINAP Code: YYY). She is in charge of admitting and taking care of all types of patients at General Hospital.</p>

<p>Due to budget constraints, Julie cares for multiple patients at the same time gathering data for other organizations in addition to MINAP. Since entering a patient&rsquo;s data for MINAP&rsquo;s web application requires being physically in front of a computer as well as time to complete the record, Julie finds the whole process &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Julie is tech-savvy in that she owns a smartphone, she has never used it for work, though. However, as she has some time with the patient while they are being admitted, Julie wonders if she could at least flag the patient for later input to MINAP&rsquo;s database through her smartphone.</p>

<p>As she checks in a new patient, Julie wonders&hellip; &ldquo;Is there an app for that?&rdquo;</p>

    <updated>2013-12-02T17:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/blog/2013/12/02/coming-out</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The team has come to realize that in order to continue the objectives this blog is to meet, it must come clean. Up to this point, information regarding our client and project has been, to a point, redacted. This is a practice that will hinder rather than help from this point on.</p>

<h3>Our Client: Project Manager for MINAP</h3>

<p><img src="http://akz08.github.io/minap-mobile/images/minap-logo.png" title="MINAP logo" ></p>

<p>The Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) investigates the management of heart attacks. Participating hospitals and ambulance services are to provide a record of their management practices. These records are then compared to national and international clinical standards. The National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) is a partnership of clinicians, IT experts, analysts, academics and managers. Its mission is to &ldquo;provide information to improve heart disease patients&#8217; quality of care and outcomes&rdquo;. Using different audits, MINAP being one of them, NICOR aims to provide the NHS, government and regulatory bodies real world data to be used in patient care. The team&rsquo;s primary point of contact is the Project Manager for MINAP, who we have referred to as the &lsquo;client&rsquo; in previous posts.</p>

<h3>Our Project: A mobile solution</h3>

<p>Participating facilities are requested to enter all patients with suspected heart attack. Data is collected by nurses and other clinical audit staff and entered in a dedicated web application. This web application collects all patient data, from demographics to diagnosis and release information. As it stands, the web application contains a 130 field dataset that is updated every two years (latest revision, June 2013). The data is then validated against a set of rules which include, but are not limited to, value range checks, date range checks, data type checks and encryption rules. Once completed, records are stored on MINAP&rsquo;s Domino server. A further look into the web application will be posted in a later post.</p>

<p>The app dev team has been tasked to produce a mobile application that will serve as a starting point for the data capture process, thus relieving clinicians of some of the burden of data entry. This project will retain the major functionality of the web application while working with a slightly reduced dataset. Validation and storage must be taken into account, as well as maintaining a semblance of familiarity for the current user base. The target platform for this mobile solution is the Android OS for smartphones.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 25th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The App Dev team decided it would be in everyone&rsquo;s best interest if no coding took place the day after the University&rsquo;s deadline. Instead, the team looked ahead to the second deadline three weeks away. Wiki resources were updated, Milestone 2 requirements were read and understood. Finally, we presented our client with a possible survey to be used for data gathering / analytics.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 26th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Per our client&rsquo;s wishes, the dataset has been reduced to 60 fields from 130 fields. The team first fleshed out how these reduced dataset would interact within the application. Abstraction was taken into account as all most of these fields would require alike functionality.</p>

<p>After separating the fields into logical &ldquo;pages,&rdquo; the meeting focused on the transition from Java coding to integrating SQL and XML into the product&rsquo;s code.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 27th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team reviewed extra documents from client that further helped with dataset rules. Sample decisions trees were sketched as per the new validation logic. Meeting was adjourned after an email to client with some questions for clarifications was sent.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 28th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The client&rsquo;s reply cleared all questions from previous meeting. After discussing this new information, the team focused on University tasks, namely the GC02 poster that would be due next Wednesday (the 4th).</p>

<p>After a brief discussion. It was decided that meetings for Friday and the weekend (the 29th through Dec 1st) would be unnecessary. As such, the team divvied up work packages to clear during these days including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making sure Java validation works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure XML parsing works on a command line level</li>
<li>Making sure SQL connection / read / write capabilities work on a command line level</li>
<li>Further insight into Android programming, HCI requirements</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 18th</h3>

<hr />

<p>As the first milestone draws close, the team started the meeting with a review of the project&rsquo;s specifications both from the client and from the University. We then moved to advance the parts that were lacking. Use cases were tabulated. Further git run-throughs were underway. Finally, our latest meeting with our client was transcribed and questions and answers were extracted from it.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 19th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entire team concentrated on coding.</p>

<p>It was deemed one more client meeting was needed before sending in the project for marking. The team wrote down all questions that may have been left out of previous communications as well as drafting out a survey prototype per client&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>Meeting was adjourned after considering a Gantt chart for drafting out the schedule of the work packages.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 20th</h3>

<hr />

<p>Our meeting with our client and the web application&rsquo;s developer went as expected. We followed up with the developer on some clarification due to the complexities of both our project and the existing web app.</p>

<p>Once again, the team checked the project&rsquo;s specifications and listed the yet unfinished sections.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 21st through Sunday Nov. 24th</h3>

<hr />

<p>The team worked throughout the rest of the week on any and all missing sections of the project.</p>

<p>Coding took place throughout most of these four days. During coding breaks, the team worked on the project report, Gantt chart, data dictionary, or UML specifications.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 24th, at 4:52 P.M., the team gathered all it sources and turned the project in for marking.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 11</h3>

<hr />

<p>The entirety of today&rsquo;s meeting was given to the development of an XML structure for the application. While an XML schema was previously designed, actual coding proved problematic.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 12</h3>

<hr />

<p>As with yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, the team continued to work on an XML solution.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, there may be a different way to get the Domino side of the client&rsquo;s application to the product.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 13</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting was less formal. XML continues to be worked on. The team requested a meeting with the client in order to present early GUI designs and, if possible, speak to the current application&rsquo;s developer. The client soon set a meeting for Friday 15th.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 14</h3>

<hr />

<p>XML was set aside for this meeting as the team focused on getting a better grip on the GUI designs as well as developing questions and talking points for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting with the client.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 15</h3>

<hr />

<p>Meeting with client.</p>

<p>While the majority of the GUI design was deemed appropriate, a navigation screen will likely have to be entirely redesigned as it could prove unwieldy for handheld platforms.</p>

<p>The client also provided further insight to the processes behind the current application in use as well as the background of the client&rsquo;s company. Unfortunately, the current application&rsquo;s developer was not able to join the team. A meeting has been set for Tuesday 19th.</p>

<p>The team also agreed to help develop a survey to find the extent of the usefulness of the proposed product as well as to provide further information about use cases for the current application.</p>

<p>The app dev team will complete University tasks for the product during the weekend and start the coding process on Monday 18th.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday &ndash; Nov. 4</h3>

<hr />

<p>Working off Friday&rsquo;s rough sketch, the app dev team fleshed out the specifications for the product. Architectural Decisions were put in place as well as a Client &ndash; Server interaction diagram.</p>

<p>The team then moved on to decide the structure of the XML files that will be used in the product&rsquo;s backend SQL Database. The frontend was also touched upon as GUIs were sketched and then integrated into the model.</p>

<h3>Tuesday &ndash; Nov. 5</h3>

<hr />

<p>The software Domingo was seen as a plausible option to network the client&rsquo;s Domino server to the app team&rsquo;s Java product. A short run-through at the beginning of this day quickly showed that more information would be needed.</p>

<p>The app dev team then proceeded to install and familiarize themselves with GitHub and its workings related to both Eclipse and other application.</p>

<p>The bulk of the meeting was then spent on converting Monday&rsquo;s sketches into classes and deciding how these mock Classes would interact with each other based on the current software&rsquo;s documents provided by the client. Along the way, the team encountered some unclear points that were, at the end of the meeting, communicated to the client asking for clarification.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &ndash; Nov. 6</h3>

<hr />

<p>Today&rsquo;s meeting started with a discussion of the requirements for this project as outlined in the University&rsquo;s email. It was deemed that the app dev team was on the right track as per said requirements. This was followed by discussing the client&rsquo;s reply to the previous meeting&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Clarifications noted, the team moved on to set up a collaborative coding environment. The applications Trello, WeChat and WindowBuilder for Eclipse were installed on the necessary terminals for each team member. Team roles were also assigned.</p>

<p>Class construction followed. Possible methods for classes were discussed and written down. Inheritance was discussed and XML configuration was delved further into.</p>

<h3>Thursday &ndash; Nov. 7</h3>

<hr />

<p>The meeting started with some further discussion into Domingo and the possible limitations of it. The JDBC Java library was then seen into as a possible way to have the XML configuration files &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the SQL end of the product.</p>

<p>Logical steps for the product were then discussed; from communication with the Domino server, to the display of a GUI on the chosen platform and back to the Domino server as a write operation.</p>

<h3>Friday &ndash; Nov. 8</h3>

<hr />

<p>Domingo has proven to be unrealiable as a solution to the team&rsquo;s need for a way to communicate with the client&rsquo;s Domino server. A different way to meet this goal must be found.</p>

<p>The app dev team then agreed to hold the next meeting on Monday the 11th</p>
